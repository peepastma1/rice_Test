Infomation about my Testing

Frontend developed by ReactJs
Backend developed by Nodejs

setup
1. Download

2. for Frontend
    -cd rice_frontend
    -npm i 
    -npm start

3. for Backend 
    -cd rice_backend
    -npm i 
    -node server.js

This project's Limitation :
- On this project Data will be save at Data.json (if not have this json file it will be created automatically).
- the function about calculating rice is on the frontend, backend role on this project is reading and writing data on data.json

what's the new thing I have to learn for coding this project?
- How to read and write in json file.

what can improve on this project? (Just in case improving myself in the future, if I have more time)
- better UX/UI (ex. responsive).
- move function from frontend to backend.
- make some code reusable.
